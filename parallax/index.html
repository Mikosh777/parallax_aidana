	<p>parallax: noun \ˈpa-rə-ˌlaks\: the apparent displacement or the difference in apparent direction of an object as seen from two different points not on a straight line with the object.</p>
	<h2>Our Approach</h2>
	<p>One of the primary things that stand out about Parallax Global is our unique point-of-view and approach to consulting engagements. <br> <br>The lens through which we view every consulting engagement is a Parallax View, which of course, as the definition of "parallax" suggests, means that we take two alternate (but not necessarily opposing) views of every problem, and compare and contrast two alternate strategies for approaching the problem. This<br> ensures that individuals, teams and management do not become victims of their own paradigms (read Thomas Kuhn's The Structure of Scientific Revolutions for more on this), that we don't get lazy, and that we can assure our clients of the deepest and most creative approaches to their problems, every time.

	<h3>The Parallax Perspective</h3>
	<p>The motion of the Sun through space provides a longer baseline that will increase the accuracy of parallax measurements, known as secular parallax.</p>
	<img src="perspective.jpg">
	<p>Other individual objects can have fundamental distance estimates made for them under special circumstances.</p>
	<p>For example, if measuring the distance between two ticks on a line with a ruler marked on its top surface</p>
	<p>Expansion parallaxes in particular can give fundamental distance estimates for objects that are very far, because supernova ejecta have large expansion velocities and large sizes (compared to stars). Further, they can be observed with radio interferometers which can measure very small angular motions</p>
	<p>The distance estimate comes from computing how far the object must be to make its observed absolute velocity appear with the observed angular motion.</p>
